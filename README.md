This repository contains the code implementation for the paper titled "Probabilistic Framework Applied to Multispectral Image Segmentation" which was submitted to the ICIR 24 Conference

This project focuses on evaluating the impact of different deep learning models and evaluation protocols on multispectral datasets collected by a UAV equipped with a multispectral camera over vineyards in Portugal. By applying probability densities to the logit values of these models for probabilistic predictions, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is employed to provide non-parametric modeling of the underlying logit-value distributions.

The study lays the groundwork for future research, suggesting that combining KDE with advanced techniques could enhance segmentation performance.

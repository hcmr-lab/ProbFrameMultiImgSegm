# Multispectral Image Segmentation in Agriculture: Evaluating Deep Learning Models with Train-Test Split and Cross-Validation Strategies

This repository contains the code implementation for the paper titled "Multispectral Image Segmentation in Agriculture: Evaluating Deep Learning Models with Train-Test Split and Cross-Validation Strategies," which was submitted to the ROBOT 24 Conference.

This project focuses on evaluating the impact of different deep learning models and evaluation protocols on multispectral datasets collected by a UAV equipped with a multispectral camera over vineyards in Portugal. By applying probability densities to the logit values of these models for probabilistic predictions, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is employed to provide non-parametric modeling of the underlying logit-value distributions.

The study lays the groundwork for future research, suggesting that combining KDE with advanced techniques could enhance segmentation performance.
